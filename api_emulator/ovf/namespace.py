    XML Namespace Class

    This class is meant to be used with the xml.etree.ElementTree module.
    Its purpose is to provide the tag() method which will replace any {<tag>}
    elements in the string with the corrent URI, provided it is in the
    namespace.

    Each prefix is simple an element in a dictionary, i.e. {<prefix>: <uri>}.

    See the tag method for the expected tag string.
